- Python installed on your computer (you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- An OpenWeatherMap API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script (`weather.py`) to your computer.

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   
3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the script with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

4. Run the script:

5. Follow the prompt to enter the city for which you want to retrieve weather information.

6. The script will display the weather data for the specified city.
